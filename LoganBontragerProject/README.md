# Bayesian Autoregression

For the project, I used an OOP code structure. The code structure is as follows.

requirements: statsmodels

main.py - This runner file executes the model on the various tasks and prints outputs to the console.

model.py - The model file contains the class and functionality used to train the model and its various components.

data/ - This folder holds the data used throughout to project.

report/ - The report folder consists of a written report discussing the codes output.

output/ - The output folder contains any graphs created in the project.
