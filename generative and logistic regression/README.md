# Generative and Bayesian Logistic Regression

For this project, I used a two file structure. The layout is as follows.

main.py - This file holds the code that reads in data, runs the algorithms, and outputs the results.

model.py - This file holds the functions used to implement the algorithms in the project.

pp3data/ - This folder holds the data used throughout to project.

report/ - The report folder consists of a written report discussing the codes output.

output/ - The output folder contains any graphs created in the project.
